                        <div class="content">
                            <p>An experienced software engineer with a Masters in Computer Science who is self-directed with a passion to build products that enrich the lives of people, fascinated by mobile application development and love to embrace the latest trends and best practices in the development process as a Software Engineer.
                            Stepping out of my comfort zone and learning new technologies is something I enjoy. I bring with me an openness to accept digression from my path and the old world values of integrity, discipline and hard work. Diversity among teammates is an asset that I value a lot. I work best in an environment of ideas and positive inputs which can be translated into meaningful products.
                            I am experienced in design and development with modern Android stacks like MVVM architecture, Live Data, REST APIs and Material Design.

                            Outside of programming, I love to play soccer and travel to places where I can generate new ideas for day-to-day problems.
